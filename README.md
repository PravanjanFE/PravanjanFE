## 👋 Hello there,

I'm so glad to meet you.  
I'm **Pravanjan Patnaik**, but you can call me **Prav**. I build exciting B2B digital products and games that people actually love using.  

For the past 17 years, I've been helping startups turn their wild ideas into reality - helping them raise over **$20M** along the way. When my clients invest **$1** with us, they typically see **$10** back.  

### 🌟 Some cool stuff I was part of:
- Being part of the **World Design Organization (WDO)** - where some of the world's best designers hang out  
- Judging **Glocha's climate change platform** (backed by **UN-Habitat**)  
- Getting featured in **ResearchGate** for figuring out some clever zero-waste management solutions  
- Have worked with brands like **ITC, Bayer, World Remit and Weill Cornell Medicine**  

I lead an amazing team that handles everything from massive projects to ongoing support work for a wide range of clients, from tiny startups to the companies on the **Forbes Top 10** list.  

I truly believe the most exciting breakthroughs come from the unexpected (**Unknown - Unknown**).  

That's why I love pushing boundaries and trying unconventional approaches.

### 🔧 My Core Skill Set:
- **Vertical SaaS**  
- **Digital Twin technologies in B2B**  
- **Product Design**  

---

I learned what works and what doesn't through both my failures and those of my clients.  

I believe we're in this wild era where even tiny teams can build massive businesses. It's all about being smart with data and letting AI do its magic.  

I'm kind of obsessed with thinking about “thinking” (iykyk 👀).  

This fascination has driven me to delve deeply into the complexities of human decision-making, even leading me to secure the **trademark for "Human Decision" in India**.

It's really nice to meet you.  
I'm looking forward to getting to know you better.  

**See you soon,**
